        "description": "This repository contains an implementation of a RISC-V RV32IM processor with a 6-stage pipeline architecture. The design includes instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back, and an additional stage for improved performance. It supports integer operations, multiplication, and memory access as defined in the RV32IM instruction set.",
