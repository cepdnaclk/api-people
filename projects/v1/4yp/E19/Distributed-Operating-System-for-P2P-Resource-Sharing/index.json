    "description": "A distributed operating system (DOS) tailored for peer-to-peer (P2P) devices connected via local network, enabling efficient resource pooling and sharing, fault tolerance, and scalability. The proposed DOS will allow devices within a local network to share excess computational resources dynamically without disrupting their native operations.",
