    "description": "This research designs a scalable, NLP-driven intent-based networking architecture for SDNs. It features a three-layered structure: Translation (NLP-based), Policy Optimization (ML/RL-based), and Intent Enforcement (SDN-integrated). The goal is to enhance network management efficiency and adaptability.",
