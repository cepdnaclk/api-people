To address these vulnerabilities, Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), \u201cNever trust, always verify\u201d is introduced.

Information processing based on spiking neuron architectures have caught considerable attention in recent years due to its low power consumption compared to traditional artificial neural networks.  In this project, as the first stage, we are implementing parallel multiple processing elements based on RISC-V architecture to represent biological neurons. Single neurons can be implemented as a single processor with local memory access or since the spike time of biological neurons is in the millisecond order multiple neurons can be virtualized to a single processor. At the second stage of the process, we are expecting to design encoders and decoders to benchmark the architecture by solving classical machine learning problems.",

Open World Object Detection refers to tackling object detection tasks in an open-world setting where the task is to detect a known set of object categories while simultaneously identifying unknown objects. Moreover, it is required to identify instances of unknown objects and subsequently learn to recognize them when training data progressively arrive. An oracle (eg: - a human annotator) is needed to introduce new class labels for the identified unknowns to classify those to relevant object classes in the next increments of learning steps.",
