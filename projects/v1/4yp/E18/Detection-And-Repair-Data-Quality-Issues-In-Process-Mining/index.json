    "title": "Detection And Repair Data Quality Issues In Process Mining",
    "description": "This research project is aimed at developing an algorithm for the detection and repair of one or a few of the identified imperfection patterns in process mining event logs. Our goal is to create a plugin for Praeclarus, a PDQ (Process Data Quality) framework that addresses imperfections, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of process analysis.",
