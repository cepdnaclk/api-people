    "description": "The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has resulted in a rapid growth in the synthesis of large genomic datasets, but user-friendly tools for finding biomarkers of genes and visualizing this data have not kept pace.  Our project is to develop a web application which can provide a user-friendly interface for Alzheimer disease prediction and finding biomarker genes for particular disease using differential expression analysis of human mRNA sequence data. We improve on available tools by offering a range of normalization, feature selection and classification methods and a simple to use interface.",
