        "description": "Monitoring and maintaining air quality and sound quality are most important aspects of city management. A significant proportion of the population lives in cities, where air quality index has exceeded limits for several air pollutants like - particulate matter (PM), ozone, nitrogen dioxide.The Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.These pollution pose serious health and environment risks. Therefore air and sound quality monitoring system is an important component of any smart city.  So in this unified project we develop a system to monitor , forecast and reducing air pollution in a city through actionable data. the data will be received from gas sensors and the sound sensor. we are trying measure the data using this module in urban areas.  All those data taken from those sensors, are sent to a central server and processed there.if the permit levels are exceed Regulatory agencies or pollution control boards will be informed.and also person can see whether the city is suitable for living and what will be the future. they can get the information about Pollution Awareness.",

The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. Sometime the garbage collector truck not sufficient for collecting all the garbage. These in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. Another issue is in the waste management is having more trucks and human resources than needed. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system.  We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more efficient system of working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we have come up with.       The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. What our system does is it gives a real time indicator of the garbage level in a trashcan at any given time using weight and volume (solar) sensors. Using that data and as the bins are containing GSM module we can give an alert signal to the municipal web server then optimize waste collection efficient routes, sufficient number of trucks and labors. It allows trash collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule.",
