So that from our project we hope to provide most important information which may be significant when finding solutions for that problem. We may implement an embedded system from which temperature,humidity, and toxic gases (CO,CO2,NO2) may be measured using relavant sensors and from these measurements it will show locations and time where air pollution is high in Kandy city.",

It\u2019s so hard to find the right bus for the right location if you don\u2019t know the right route number. So, we feel this all happens due to the inefficiency and mismanagement of resources.

Filtering of water can be done by measuring and analyzing the oxygen level of water so that there will be a sufficient amount of oxygen for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. Even though the system will be operated automatically, the user or the owner of the aquarium could check the aquarium's filtering process anytime he/she want as there is a web page connected to this system which is updating automatically when all the filtering activities are happening.",

Therefore air and sound quality monitoring system is an important component of any smart city.  So in this unified project we develop a system to monitor , forecast and reducing air pollution in a city through actionable data. the data will be received from gas sensors and the sound sensor. we are trying measure the data using this module in urban areas.  All those data taken from those sensors, are sent to a central server and processed there.if the permit levels are exceed Regulatory agencies or pollution control boards will be informed.and also person can see whether the city is suitable for living and what will be the future. they can get the information about Pollution Awareness.",

These systems make it possible to supply power even when the sun is down because of the stored heat energy. In these power plants, array of flat movable mirrors called heliostats are used to focus sunlight into a collector tower to heat salts and generate electricity through steam turbines. This is seen as  a viable solution for renewable energy.",

                        "description": "Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. Sometime the garbage collector truck not sufficient for collecting all the garbage. These in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. Another issue is in the waste management is having more trucks and human resources than needed. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system.  We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more efficient system of working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we have come up with.       The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. What our system does is it gives a real time indicator of the garbage level in a trashcan at any given time using weight and volume (solar) sensors. Using that data and as the bins are containing GSM module we can give an alert signal to the municipal web server then optimize waste collection efficient routes, sufficient number of trucks and labors. It allows trash collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule.",

In most of our day-to-day life, we have experienced that air conditioners, projectors are working unnecessarily even without a presence of a meeting and sometimes those devices should be controlled with a human involvement using several types of remote controllers which is really an inefficient way. Our approach to that matter is automating this process introducing a control unit per each meeting room and a client application. Client application is basically used for scheduling meetings and meeting room configurations that data related to air conditioners and projectors is set. Control unit in meeting room sends required signals to turn on/off devices according to the schedules added to the system by the client application. In addition to that, mobile application can be used to control devices by scanning a QR code.",

On the contrary, in high-stakes settings as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, have strict ethical concerns which lead to explain each decision or the model in whole. Moreover, there it is necessary to ensure the fairness of the decisions and the transparency to avoid wrongful rationality.

Skim sequencing is obtaining low coverage genome sequencing data that includes, nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondria genome sequences. Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome (usually about 20-30GB data), which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. To date, there are many assembly processes/pipelines described to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. However, how much data is needed or actually used in such analysis is not clear. Having such information will help biologists to design their experiments properly and cost-effectively. Biologists expect a simple, fast and user-friendly procedure to assemble and annotate a circular chloroplast genome using Illumina NGS data.   In this project, we will research the existing procedures for chloroplast genome assembly and annotation, and work on developing the methods to identify and select the optimal set(s) of data and the procedure(s) to assemble a given chloroplast genome as accurately and efficiently as possible, by using computational, statistical & heuristical methods.

They have used several DNA based methods for phylogeny such as DNA extraction, DNA replication and DNA sequencing. Skim sequencing is the most preferred sequencing method since it results in low coverage data at a low cost.  Biologists have identified a fast-evolving region called Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) inside nuclear ribosomal DNA repeats of eukaryotic cells. They prefer to isolate this ITS region from skim sequencing data since it leads to a more accurate species variation analysis. However, because of the huge of data and unclarity on how much data is minimum needed, they find it much difficult to gather ITS regions as efficiently and as accurately as possible.  Therefore, the purpose of this project is come with a simple, efficient, accurate and user-friendly procedure to isolate ITS regions from skim sequencing data to provide a clear pathway for the biologists for phylogenetic studies to solve their problems.",

While identifying human emotions, identifying emotions of animal subjects is equally important since it will help to understand their perspectives, needs and problems related to their physical and mental well-being while safeguarding their welfare. Therefore, a preliminary analysis to identify similarities and differences between human and animal emotion recognition is done.",

A dataset obtained from NCBI database under the access number GSE46579 is used. To achieve the goal of finding the best set of differentially expressed miRNAs, we followed a step wise procedure including five main steps as data collection, preprocessing, statistical analysis, feature selection and classification. Under the data collection stage, initial data set was chosen. We used Galaxy platform for preprocessing. The statistical analysis included significance value (pValue) analysis, fold change analysis followed by the area under receiver operating curve (AUC) analysis. For the features reduced from the statistical methods, feature selection was done under three methods as PCA, Random Forest and correlation coefficient analysis. We used classification algorithms for presenting the possibilty of miRNAs in making better predictions. In this project, we used python programming language for both statistical analysis and machine learning analysis of the data.",

Although near-IR spectroscopy is identified as a good solution, its usage is limited to availability, high cost, and doubts about accuracy. The cost of each of these products is very high and not affordable especially in countries like ours. We have implemented a mechanism for better accuracy and lower risk, using an illumination system that favors Asian skin types, while reducing the cost of the device so that it is more affordable especially for common clinical use in countries like ours.",

Human action recognition is a well-studied problem in computer vision and on the other hand action quality assessment is researched and experimented comparatively low. This is due to the lack of datasets that can be used to assess the quality of actions. In this research, we introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level. We intended to develop a viable automated scoring system through action recognition that would be beneficial in the sports industry. ",

Early flood forecasting can be used to identify potential areas of flooding in order to develop mitigatory planning and evacuation programs to remove people from such areas during flooding and also to implement suitable preventive measures to avoid damage to properties. In this project, our main objective is to build a flood forecasting system for Mi Oya river basin(Sri Lanka). Mi Oya Basin is heavily affected by seasonal flooding and droughts. As per the available data, floods in the Mi Oya basin are unleashed due to river overflow and reservoir spilling. Out of the several reservoirs located in the basin, Tabbowa and Inginimitiya are crucial in worsening the flood impacts as these two reservoirs are frequently spilling under adverse weather conditions. As such, the prevalence of a real-time flood forecasting model with the incorporation of the reservoir operations for the entire basin is essential to alleviate the flood induced impacts while preserving the optimum volume of water in the major reservoirs in the basin.",

In contrast, greenhouse farming is a system where farmer cultivate crops in ecosystem environments where all environmental parameters are adjusted based on crop types. Automation in greenhouse is a method where farmer can monitor and control the greenhouse environment automatically from anywhere in the world any time. Automated greenhouse monitoring and controlling system that incorporate various sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor and light sensor to collect possible environmental parameters of greenhouse. Internet of Things (IoT) is used to store data to a database and process the collected data and finally send the information to the web interface which has been developed for monitoring and controlling of greenhouse by the user.",
