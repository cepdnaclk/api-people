    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "The authors present their conceptual design of an automated design environment for electric motors, its tools, and their implementation. From suitable specifications and requirements, the challenging automation of the initial stage of engineering design involves the use of heuristic and experiential knowledge of experts. This is followed by mathematical optimization of the initial design. The authors focus here on their knowledge-based engineering assistant that employs codified rules of the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association.",
