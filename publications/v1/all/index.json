        "year": "2020",
        "abstract": "Low light image enhancement is an important challenge for the development of robust computer vision algorithms. The machine learning approaches to this have been either unsupervised, supervised based on paired dataset or supervised based on unpaired dataset. This paper presents a novel deep learning pipeline that can learn from both paired and unpaired datasets. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that are optimized to minimize standard loss, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are optimized to minimize the adversarial loss are used to achieve different steps of the low light image enhancement process. Cycle consistency loss and a patched discriminator are utilized to further improve the performance. The paper also analyses the functionality and the performance of different components, hidden layers, and the entire pipeline.",

The existing accurate detection mechanism (pulse oximetry) is a skin contact measurement. The existing non-contact mechanisms (acoustics, video processing) are not accurate enough. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the detection of sleep apnea with video processing. The solution is non-contact, accurate and lightweight enough to run on a single board computer. The paper discusses the accuracy of the algorithm on real data, advantages of the new algorithm, its limitations and suggests future improvements.",

        "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or chronic renal disease has become a major issue with a steady growth rate. A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.",

        "venue": "Journal of Spectral Imaging",
        "year": "2019",
        "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

However, advances in in situ genomics require parallel development of portable, offline solutions for the computational analysis of sequencing data. Here we introduce Genopo, a mobile toolkit for nanopore sequencing analysis. Genopo compacts popular bioinformatics tools to an Android application, enabling fully portable computation. To demonstrate its utility for in situ genome analysis, we use Genopo to determine the complete genome sequence of the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in nine patient isolates sequenced on a nanopore device, with Genopo executing this workflow in less than 30\u00e2\u0080\u0089min per sample on a range of popular smartphones. We further show how Genopo can be used to profile DNA methylation in a human genome sample, illustrating a flexible, efficient architecture that is suitable to run many popular bioinformatics tools and accommodate small or large genomes. As the first ever smartphone application for nanopore sequencing analysis, Genopo enables the genomics community to harness this cheap, ubiquitous computational resource.",

        "abstract": "[BACKGROUND:] Nanopore sequencing enables portable, real-time sequencing applications, including point-of-care diagnostics and in-the-field genotyping. Achieving these outcomes requires efficient bioinformatic algorithms for the analysis of raw nanopore signal data. However, comparing raw nanopore signals to a biological reference sequence is a computationally complex task. The dynamic programming algorithm called Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a crucial step in polishing sequencing data and identifying non-standard nucleotides, such as measuring DNA methylation. Here, we parallelise and optimise an implementation of the ABEA algorithm (termed f5c) to efficiently run on heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures. [RESULTS:] By optimising memory, computations and load balancing between CPU and GPU, we demonstrate how f5c can perform \u00e2\u0088\u00bc3-5 \u00c3\u0097 faster than an optimised version of the original CPU-only implementation of ABEA in the Nanopolish software package. We also show that f5c enables DNA methylation detection on-the-fly using an embedded System on Chip (SoC) equipped with GPUs. [CONCLUSIONS:] Our work not only demonstrates that complex genomics analyses can be performed on lightweight computing systems, but also benefits High-Performance Computing (HPC). The associated source code for f5c along with GPU optimised ABEA is available at https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c.",

Generating reflectance and shading from a single image is a challenging task specifically when there is no ground truth. There is a lack of unsupervised learning approaches for decomposing an image into reflectance and shading using a single image. We propose a neural network architecture capable of this decomposition using physics-based parameters derived from the image. Through experimental results, we show that (a) the proposed methodology outperforms the existing deep learning-based IID techniques and (b) the derived parameters improve the efficacy significantly. We conclude with a closer analysis of the results (numerical and example images) showing several avenues for improvement.",

        "year": "2021",
        "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera Communication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a human-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such screen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (\u00e2\u0089\u00a50.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (~ 2m).",

The need of authentication is essential as the private data sent over the Internet has risk of being wiretapped. Existing password authentication schemes can be divided into two types, one that requires only the weak password and the other that requires the strong password. The main objective of this paper is to present a review on the strong password protocols and propose a new protocol with enhanced security features. In addition, we have proved that our SAS-3 (simple and secure) protocol is secure against replay, denial of service, impersonation and password guessing attacks with minimized computational and transmission overheads.",

Computing research has become a vital part in driving biological discovery where analysis and categorization of biological data are involved. String matching algorithms can be applied for protein/gene sequence matching and with the phenomenal increase in the size of string databases to be analyzed, software implementations of these algorithms seems to have hit a hard limit and hardware acceleration is increasingly being sought. Several hardware platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Chip Multi Processors (CMP) are being explored as hardware platforms. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the literature on hardware acceleration of string matching algorithms, we take an FPGA hardware exploration and expedite the design time by a design automation technique. Further, our design automation is also optimized for better hardware utilization through optimizing the number of peptides that can be represented in an FPGA tile. The results indicate significant improvements in design time and hardware utilization which are reported in this paper.",

A model based design approach was followed. We started from a state chart model developed for a prototype elevator with three floors. Extension of the model for a variable number of floors was considered. Controller for the prototype system was implemented in ladder logic on a PLC and the limitations of that approach with regard to re-configurability were identified: viz., in the extension of elevator controller for `N' no of floors. Next VHDL code was developed for a reconfigurable elevator controller where, by changing a variable corresponding to the required number of floors, the suitable code can be generated. The controller thus generated can be implemented in an FPGA. The method was successfully tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3AN FPGA.",

        "abstract": "Statechart formalism has been a preferred choice for modeling complex reactive systems (CRS) in recent years. It has inbuilt powerful features of orthogonality, hierarchy, intermodular communication and history. Once statechart based system modeling is done the next issues to be addressed are (1) modular verification of the system for failsafe operation under all possible working conditions (2) progressive controller implementation together with the supervisory control while maintaining traceability and re-configurability and (3) facilitation of controller adaptation for progressive incorporation of security features and supervisory specifications. An elevator system was designed and built to reflect exigencies of a typical CRS hardware/software platform. A controller was designed to meet the above requirements and tested on the platform to validate the feasibility of model-based control design/verification methodology for real scale systems. Modularity was achieved by developing the statechart model of the plant into a tree of communicating language generators. Progresively verified modules were then translated into sequential function charts (SFC) which were finally integrated to form a complete flat SFC. The SFC was then implemented on a PLC platform (Telemechanique). The program was first validated in simulation using Telemechanique \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwidosuite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for different operating conditions and finally tested on the elevator system.",

Although Aho-Corasick was one of the commonly used exact multiple strings matching algorithm, Commentz-Walter has been introduced as a better alternative in the recent past. Comments-Walter algorithm combines ideas from both Aho-Corasick and Boyer Moore. Large scale rapid and accurate peptide identification is critical in computational proteomics. In this paper, we have critically analyzed the time complexity of Aho-Corasick and Commentz-Walter for their suitability in large scale peptide identification. According to the results we obtained for our dataset, we conclude that Aho-Corasick is performing better than Commentz-Walter as opposed to the common beliefs.",

A software only approach is used to compare the throughput and the scalability of the hardware software co-design approach. According to the results we obtained, we conclude that the hardware software co-design implementation shows a maximum of 10 times speed up for pattern size of 1200 peptides compared to the software only implementation. The results also show that the hardware software co-design approach scales well for increasing data size compared to the software only approach.",

        "abstract": "Currently there is a new trend in the design of Complex Reactive Systems (CRS) towards model based development. Software components are no longer hard written in C or Assembler code but modeled with MATLAB/Simulink, Statemate or similar tools. Model based designs allow development of high level models that can be used for simulations in very early stages of the design process. However the quality assurance of model based developments, specially testing is still poorly supported [1]. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of model based design process and the need of quality assurance methods throughout the design process. We have selected a fully functional prototype passenger elevator as the CRS. A model based design approach is followed throughout the design phase. Model-in-the loop (MiL) testing is carried out as the quality assurance technique and the results are presented. Then the translation of the MiL test into a Hardware-in the-loop (HiL) test is presented.",

This paper presents a framework for protein inference, which uses hardware accelerated protein inference framework for handling the most important step in a bottom-up approach, viz. peptide identification during the assembling process. In our framework, identified peptides and their probabilities are used to predict the most suitable reference protein cluster for a given input amino acid sequence with the probability of identified peptides. The framework is developed on an FPGA where hardware software co-design techniques are used to accelerate the computationally intensive parts of the protein inference process.

        "abstract": "The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources in respect of the required very high processing throughputs, rapid processing rates and reliability of results. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these (permitted) variations, the applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b) the difficulty of defining a reference (peptide/amino acid) sequence for a particular set of proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in features. This paper presents a model-based hardware acceleration of a structured and practical inference approach that is developed and validated to solve the inference problem in a mass spectrometry experiment of realistic size. Our approach starts from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their respective locations on the GCSS. The hypothesis made here is that these latter substrings (SSLV) appear inside complete peptides and not cutting across peptide boundaries. Then we define and solve the Sub-string Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT) using the Bit-Split Aho Corasick Algorithm with Limited Tolerance (BSACLT) that we define and automate. This approach is validated on identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT. A model-based hardware software co-design strategy is used to accelerate the computational workflow of above described protein inference problem. Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application instance. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. The co-designed workflow achieved up to 70 times maximum speed-up compared to a similar workflow purely run on the processor used for co-design.",

Designing such protocols in reconfigurable hardware such as FPGA has been attempted to overcome these limitations. The use of reconfigurable hardware is needed in the development phase and could eventually lead to ASICs for better performance. However, mission critical nature of such applications needs a performance guarantee on design.

With the increase of the number of machines within processing plants and their operational complexities, many engineers and researchers have started looking for automated solutions for these tasks. In most of the proposed solutions, these dynamic systems are modelled using tools like automata, Petri nets, bond graphs and Bayesian networks to diagnose and predict faults in those systems. This paper reviews these graphical model-based techniques related to fault diagnosis and prognosis and give suggestions for future research directions identifying research gaps in the field.",

        "abstract": "Today's network transactions are usually handled using kernel-based network protocols residing on general-purpose processors (GPPs). Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA. In this paper we discuss the logic behind our new architecture and the results up to now.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a reconfigurable hardware implementation of CommentzWalter algorithm with bit-split string matching engines to match multiple protein sequences. It is reported that multiple pattern matching using the most widely used Aho-Corasick algorithm for different applications has been carried out on graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays to accelerate the matching process. Commentz-Walter algorithm, is a multiple pattern matching algorithm and more complex than Aho-Corasick. There are no reports of it being directly implemented in any hardware platform except as software implementations on general purpose processors. In this work, a specific architecture for our target application using CommentzWalter algorithm has been developed and tested with a simulator for hardware description languages. This architecture can match multiple patterns of proteins efficiently when implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array. Finally, we compare a previously developed hardware architecture of bit-split Aho-Corasick with our bit-split Commentz-Walter architecture. Using the Intel Stratix IV GX EP4SGX230KF40C2 FPGA chip as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that the synthesis logic utilization is 5% with 2203 total number of registers, 64896 FPGA block memory bits and 4 DSP block 18-bit elements. The simulation and practical experimental results show that the proposed architecture can effectively improve the performance of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.",
